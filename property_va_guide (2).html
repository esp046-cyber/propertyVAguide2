                    Total Commission: 5% of sale price<br>

                    Total Commission: 5% of sale price<br>
                    - Broker: 70-80%<br>
                    - VA: 20-30%</p>

                    - Referral fee: 10-20% of total commission<br>
                    - VA brings buyer to broker, receives referral percentage</p>

                    <h3>Formula</h3>
                    <div class="highlight">
                        <p><strong>Your Commission = (Selling Price × Total Commission %) × Your Split %</strong><br><br>
                        <strong>Step by Step:</strong><br>
                        1. Multiply selling price by commission rate<br>
                        2. Multiply result by your agreed percentage<br>
                        3. Subtract taxes if applicable</p>

                    Commission Rate: 5%<br>
                    Your Split: 25%<br>
                    Your Earning: ₱3,500,000 × 5% × 25% = ₱43,750</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Example 2: Condo Rental</strong><br>
                    Monthly Rent: ₱30,000<br>
                    Commission: 1 month rent<br>
                    Your Split: 30%<br>
                    Your Earning: ₱30,000 × 30% = ₱9,000</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Example 3: Commercial Lot</strong><br>
                    Selling Price: ₱12,000,000<br>

                    <p><strong>A:</strong> No, you don't need a real estate broker license to work as a VA. However, you cannot directly sell properties or sign contracts. You work under a licensed broker who handles the actual transactions. Your role is administrative and marketing support.</p>

                        <li><strong>Prescription Period:</strong> 10 years for ordinary, 30 years for extraordinary possession</li>
                        <li><strong>Community Property:</strong> Property acquired during marriage is conjugal (both spouses own)</li>

                        <li><strong>OCT (Original Certificate of Title):</strong> First title issued for land</li>
                        <li><strong>Tax Declaration:</strong> NOT proof of ownership, only for tax purposes</li>
